Click on one of three comment buttons to gain Chaos!
With the Sarcastic and Troll comments you get more Chaos, but
you have a chance of getting a strike!
Three strikes and your account is terminated!  
When your account is terminated, you lose
your points and your followers, but you keep the upgrades 
you buy within the Chaos shop.

Pressing the Sarcastic or Troll comment buttons also can give you followers 
depending on the amount of Chaos you currently have.
Followers give you more Chaos over time. You can buy upgrades to keep some of the 
followers over an account termination.
